# Collections

If we want to represent a group of individual object as a single entity than we should we go for collection.

- Collections are growable in nature that is based on our requirement, we can increase or decrease the size.
- Collections can hold bold homogeneous and heterogeneous objects.
- Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure. For every requirement ready made support is available.
- Being a programmer we are responsible to use those method and we are not responsible to implement those methods.

## Arrays

### Arrays drawbacks

- Fixed in size. Once array is created you can't change its size.
- Hold only **homogeneous** data type.
  - You can eliminate this drawback using create Object array.
- No underlining data structure.
  - If you want to sort array you have to write code for sorting.
