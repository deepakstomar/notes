# Set Interface

The `Set` interface is a child interface of `Collection`. It represents a group of objects as a single entity, where duplicates are not allowed and the order of insertion is not preserved.

**Key characteristics:**

* **Duplicates:** Not Allowed
* **Insertion Order:** Not Preserved

**Key Methods:**

The `Set` interface itself does not define any new methods. You'll need to refer to the `Collection` interface for available methods.
